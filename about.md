I am a 3rd year student at Rutgers University studying Computer Science.

I work on solving interesting problems and building innovative systems, especially in the domains of computer vision, machine learning, and distributed systems.

I am currently in the process of moving to Hawthorne, California to join SpaceX full-time as a software engineer while finishing my bachelor's degree remotely.
